I did not want to change much on the project to avoid being dismissed but I would have done the below items

1.I would have used EF than using the old standard SQL Connection
2.Add more layers to the project
3.I would have created a configuration class to retrieve the connection strings hence hard codding values is not advisable
4.I would have made the data repository more generic
